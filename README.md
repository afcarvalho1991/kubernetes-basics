# Cheat sheet for kubernetes + DEMO

 **Key concepts:**
	 
 - **node**:  host machine that can execute 0 to N pods;
 - **pod**: a group of one or more containers, with shared storage/network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers
 - **deployment_yaml**: should be a manifest that describes how many pods and which containers should run on each group of pods;
 - **service_yaml**: should enable the load balance between a set of pods associated to each label ( created on the deployment_yaml), note that this file is also responsible for stating the networking rules i.e. the firewall rules and ports to expose;  

## Load config variable to communicate with the cluster master node (file generated by the cloud provider)
    export KUBECONFIG=cluster-kubeconfig.yaml  

## Check the connection and state of all nodes
    kubectl get nodes

## Check pods states
    kubectl get pods

## Check existing deployments
    kubectl get deployments

## Check existing services
    kubectl get services

## Check detailed pods states
    kubectl describe pods

## Check pods states clear view
    kubectl get pods -o wide

## Deploy 1 pod (for testing purposes only)
    kubectl run PODNAME --image=DOCKER_IMAGE --port=80

## Delete a running pod
    kubectl delete pods PODNAME

## Delete all pods
    kubectl delete pods --all

## Deploy a set of pods using a deployment manifest
    kubectl apply -f DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST_YAML

## Exposing our pods using a service manifest i.e. create a Load Balancer pod
    kubectl apply -f SERVICE_MANIFEST_YAML

## Edit a currently running deployment, service or pod
    kubectl edit deployment DEPLOYMENT_NAME
    kubectl edit service SERVICE_NAME
    kubectl edit pods POD_NAME // most likely not needed
